# IronMan

### About:
Iron man is a project discovering the capabilities of remote presence with modern gadgets. We have used Oculust Rift VR headset together with Tello quad copter to provide basic remote presense experience.

## The project consists of two main parts:
- server for communication with Tello, based on DJITello SDK
- Oculus Rift App, written in C# and constructed in Unity

The project is a work in progress, currently we support video streaming and manual controls but plan to add controla via headset in the nearest future.
